Install required libraries

pip install pyperclip
pip install pyautogui



I have this script on a keyboard shortcut.   It will take any copied text and emulate keys being pressed on the keyboard.  There is a 2 second delay so you can click into the cloud environment and it will send the copied text/script into the cloud.  It can paste a large script file.  The delay can be increased by modifying the script.  I will export an EXE for Windows users without python.
